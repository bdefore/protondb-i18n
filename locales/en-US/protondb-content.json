Underneath the hood, Proton comprises other popular tools like Wine and DXVK among others that a gamer would otherwise have to install and maintain themselves. This greatly eases the burden for users to switch to Linux without having to learn the underlying systems or losing access to a large part of their library of games. Proton is still in its infancy so support is inconsistent, but regularly improving.",

A growing pool of suggestions provides tweaks that you can try to get games working while Proton continues development. In addition to this, you may explore the Steam game catalog on this site to browse and discover a wide range of titles that were previously unavailable for use on Linux.",

Most of what you may be used to on Windows or MacOS is possible on Linux without having to tinker too much, and the tinkering can even be fun. Meanwhile, more and more of our daily interactions with a computer happen online, and browsers behave much the same on Linux as they do on other operating systems. Proton and Steam Play address a significant obstacle to adoption: gaming, where until recently there was limited compatibility.",
